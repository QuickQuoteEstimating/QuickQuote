# Final Cleanup Verification

## Navigation Flow
- Auth stack redirects authenticated sessions directly into the tab navigator while unauthenticated users see the auth stack. 【F:app/(auth)/_layout.tsx†L5-L20】
- The tab navigator exposes the Home, Customers, Estimates, and Settings routes with consistent theming and guards unauthenticated access. 【F:app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx†L8-L105】

## Theming
- Theme context dynamically tracks the system appearance and exposes a toggle for manual overrides. 【F:theme/ThemeProvider.tsx†L14-L41】
- Each tab screen consumes themed styles so typography, surfaces, and controls respond to light/dark mode (example: Home screen). 【F:app/(tabs)/home.tsx†L235-L356】
- Users can toggle between light and dark appearances from Settings, which applies the theme-aware styles app-wide. 【F:app/(tabs)/settings.tsx†L25-L314】

## Offline Support
- Local SQLite bootstrapping creates queue tables for pending mutations and normalizes schema for customers, estimates, items, photos, and saved items. 【F:lib/sqlite.ts†L39-L220】
- Queue helpers persist pending changes, enabling later sync attempts. 【F:lib/sqlite.ts†L262-L289】
- Root layout initializes the database and retries sync whenever the app becomes active to flush queued work. 【F:app/_layout.tsx†L131-L170】
- Customer creation writes to SQLite immediately, queues the mutation, and triggers a sync when connectivity allows. 【F:components/CustomerForm.tsx†L41-L95】
- Estimate creation/update mirrors the same pattern for estimates, line items, and photos, including retrying sync. 【F:app/(tabs)/estimates/create-view.tsx†L1080-L1336】

## Soft Delete Coverage
- Customer deletions soft-delete related estimates, line items, and photos, queue the mutations, and trigger sync. 【F:app/(tabs)/customers.tsx†L288-L382】
- Estimate deletions apply soft deletes to the estimate, items, and photos before queuing sync work. 【F:app/(tabs)/estimates/[id].tsx†L2111-L2165】

## Testing & Tooling
- Updated the `requires an authenticated user` test to avoid unused references while keeping full behavior coverage. 【F:__tests__/newEstimate.test.tsx†L236-L297】
- ESLint now passes without warnings, and the targeted Jest suite succeeds (`npm run lint`, `npm test -- --runTestsByPath __tests__/newEstimate.test.tsx`). 【c95fea†L1-L5】【4fe090†L1-L11】

## Platform Scripts
- `npm run web`, `npm run android`, and `npm run ios` start long-running Expo Metro servers; these were not executed in CI because the environment cannot host interactive Metro processes. Manual invocation remains unchanged from previous verification.
