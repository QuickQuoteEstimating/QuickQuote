# QuickQuote

This project is an [Expo](https://expo.dev/) application that uses the Expo Router for navigation
alongside Supabase-backed authentication and local SQLite persistence. The project configuration targets
the latest stable Expo SDK (51) and the corresponding React Native 0.74 release.

## Getting started

1. Copy the provided `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your Supabase project details.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The Expo CLI will prompt you to launch the application on a connected device, emulator, or the web.
