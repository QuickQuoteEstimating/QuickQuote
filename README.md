# QuickQuote

This project is an [Expo](https://expo.dev/) application that uses the Expo Router for navigation
alongside Supabase-backed authentication and local SQLite persistence. The project configuration has
been updated to target the latest stable Expo SDK (51) and the corresponding React Native 0.74
release.

## Getting started

```bash
cd quickquote
npm install
npm run start
```

The Expo CLI will prompt you to launch the application on a connected device, emulator, or the web.
